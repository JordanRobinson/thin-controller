Basic plan:

make a service class
start the service class (do something like log every minute)
capture a headphone event in the service class
make a sound whenever the headphone button is pressed ( <- super important)
start automating things (start with music play/pause or something)
start preferencing stuff up

Other stuff:

do up some fancy UI stuff
get me an icon
home screen with explanations

More advanced stuff:

how does tasker do things? try to do that cause it's probably best practice
start on phone startup or wait for user? (also needs a pref, nobody likes forced startup crap. Looking at you skype.)
what do we do if there's another headphone event capturing client

Would be nice if:

saying the time, with preferences for format and TTS engine
weather? Anything that you would get your phone out of your pocket for
turning track to speech on or off would be pretty sweeeet
handling things like long presses, different patterns (might be difficult)
we supported super-ancient stuff, (gingerbread, froyo, eclair, dairymilk or whatever) but probably unlikely
can we figure out if headphones are actually plugged in? last thing we want is music randomly playing from the user's perspective, or the time being read out constantly with no way to stop it
